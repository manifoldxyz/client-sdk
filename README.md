# Why Manifold Client SDK?

The **Manifold Client SDK** exists to enable builders to create their own web3 apps, where [the creator is the platform.](https://manifoldxyz.substack.com/p/manifold-creator)&#x20;

This toolkit complements [**Manifold Studio**](https://studio.manifold.xyz/) such that anyone can create:

* **Custom storefronts** – Fetch products, check allocations, verify allowlists, and more.
* **Trusted checkout flows** – Secure web3 transactions with Manifold’s audited smart contracts.
* **Wallet agnostic UIs** – Official support for `ethers v5` and `viem`, with more adapters coming.

To learn more about how to build your own app and seamlessly integrate onchain purchases for your audience, see [**Getting Started**](getting-started.md)**.**

If you have any questions or feedback, see our [**FAQ**](guides/faq.md) or our [**Community Forum**](https://forum.manifold.xyz).
