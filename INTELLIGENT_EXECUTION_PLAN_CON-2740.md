# Intelligent Execution Plan - Enhanced with Discovery Intelligence

## CON-2740: Provider Adapters Implementation

## üìä Plan Overview

- **Total Stages**: 4 (Stabilization ‚Üí Contracts ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Integration)
- **Estimated Time**: 4 weeks
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 5 identified (3 adapter implementations, 2 test streams)
- **Critical Path**: Stabilization ‚Üí Contract Definition ‚Üí Integration

## üîç Discovery-Driven Foundation

### Auto-Discovered Type Contracts (Critical Priority)

Based on comprehensive dependency analysis from the /discover command, these contracts MUST be built first as they are used across multiple components:

### Type Contracts Foundation

```typescript
// Auto-discovered from dependency analysis:
interface IAccountAdapter {
  address: string;                                      // Used by: preparePurchase, getAllocations
  sendTransaction(tx: UniversalTransactionRequest): Promise<UniversalTransactionResponse>; // Used by: step.execute, BlindMint
  getBalance(token?: string): Promise<Money>;           // Used by: preparePurchase validation
  getConnectedNetworkId(): Promise<number>;             // Used by: network validation
  switchNetwork(chainId: number): Promise<void>;        // Used by: cross-chain purchases
}

interface UniversalTransactionRequest {
  to: string;                                          // Discovered from: TransactionStep patterns
  value?: string;                                      // Discovered from: Money class integration
  data?: string;                                       // Discovered from: Contract calls
  gasLimit?: string;                                   // Discovered from: Gas estimation utils
}
```

**Rationale from Discovery**: These interfaces emerged from analyzing 15+ files with direct ethers usage and identifying common patterns across TransactionStep, preparePurchase, and execute flows.
**Time**: 2-3 days  
**Critical**: These enable all subsequent implementation stages

### Architecture Foundation (Sequential)

**Agent**: software-engineer  
**Tasks**:
1. Fix Money class export issue (blocking build)
2. Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
3. Stabilize test suite
**Time**: 3-5 days  
**Dependencies**: Must complete before adapter implementation

## üöÄ Implementation Stages (Dependency-Ordered)

### Stage 1: Stabilization (Days 1-5)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocking all development

```yaml
parallel_tasks:
  - task: Fix Money Export
    agent: software-engineer
    time: 4 hours
    blocks: everything
    
  - task: TypeScript Errors
    agent: software-engineer
    time: 1-2 days
    dependencies: [Money Export]
    
sequential_tasks:
  - task: Test Suite Stabilization
    agent: qa-engineer
    time: 2 days
    dependencies: [TypeScript Errors]
```

### Stage 2: Contract Definition (Days 6-10)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Foundation for all adapters

```yaml
parallel_execution:
  team_1:
    - agent: type-contract
      contracts:
        - IProviderAdapter
        - UniversalTransactionRequest
        - UniversalTransactionResponse
      time: 2 days
      
  team_2:
    - agent: type-contract
      contracts:
        - IAccountAdapter
        - NetworkAdapter
        - LibraryBridge<T>
      time: 2 days
      
validation:
  - agent: verification-agent
    task: Validate contract compatibility
    time: 1 day
```

### Stage 3: Adapter Implementation (Days 11-18)
**Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality delivery

```yaml
parallel_execution_matrix:
  ethers5_adapter:
    agent: backend-engineer
    dependencies: [IAccountAdapter, IProviderAdapter]
    complexity: LOW (existing integration)
    time: 3 days
    
  ethers6_adapter:
    agent: backend-engineer
    dependencies: [IAccountAdapter, IProviderAdapter]
    complexity: MEDIUM (breaking changes)
    time: 4 days
    
  viem_adapter:
    agent: backend-engineer
    dependencies: [IAccountAdapter, IProviderAdapter]
    complexity: HIGH (new integration)
    time: 5 days
    
  test_development:
    agent: qa-engineer
    parallel_with: adapter_implementation
    time: continuous
```

### Stage 4: Integration & Validation (Days 19-23)
**Priority**: HIGH - System integration

```yaml
sequential_tasks:
  - task: Provider Factory Integration
    agent: software-engineer
    integrates:
      - All adapter implementations
      - CustomProviderFactory
      - ManifoldBridgeProvider
    time: 2 days
    
  - task: Transaction Flow Integration
    agent: software-engineer
    integrates:
      - preparePurchase flow
      - step.execute flow
      - TransactionStep updates
    time: 2 days
    
  - task: End-to-End Testing
    agent: qa-engineer
    validates:
      - Cross-library compatibility
      - Network switching
      - BlindMint full workflow
    time: 1 day
```

## üîÄ Parallel Opportunities

### High Parallelization (3+ concurrent tasks)
1. **Adapter Implementation Phase**
   - 3 adapters developed simultaneously
   - Test suite development in parallel
   - Documentation updates concurrent

### Medium Parallelization (2 concurrent tasks)
2. **Contract Definition Phase**
   - Core contracts team
   - Adapter contracts team

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Unit test stream
   - Integration test stream

### Sequential Requirements
- Stabilization must complete first
- Integration requires all adapters
- E2E testing is final gate

- Fallback: Deliver ethers adapters first, viem in v2

**Risk 3: Integration failures between adapters**
- Mitigation: Daily integration tests from Day 11
- Fallback: Adapter-specific workarounds accepted

**Risk 4: Performance degradation**

## üéØ Critical Path

```
Money Fix ‚Üí TypeScript Fix ‚Üí Test Fix ‚Üí Contracts ‚Üí Integration
```

Any delay in this path delays the entire project. Parallel opportunities exist around the critical path but don't accelerate it.
