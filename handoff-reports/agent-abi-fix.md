# ABI Fix Agent - Handoff Report

## Summary
Successfully resolved critical build failures in CON-2729 BlindMint implementation by adding missing GachaExtension ABI files. The TypeScript compilation errors related to missing ABI imports have been eliminated.

## Tasks Completed ✅

### 1. **Critical ABI Files Added**
- Created `src/abis/GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv1.ts` for contract `0x53c37ccc1c48f63bd35ffc93952d0880d7529b9e`
- Created `src/abis/GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv2.ts` for contract `0x40ae3553a2dbbe463f84da97bda5607cfd03b40d`
- Both files contain complete ABI definitions with proper TypeScript exports

### 2. **Proper Export Structure**
- Created `src/abis/index.ts` to export both ABI files consistently
- Used named exports: `GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv1` and `GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv2`
- Follows existing project patterns for ABI exports

### 3. **Build Verification**
- Ran `npm run typecheck` to confirm ABI-related errors are resolved
- No more missing ABI import errors in TypeScript compilation
- Build now proceeds without ABI-related failures

### 4. **Version Control**
- All changes committed to `agent/abi-fix` branch
- Commit: `01cb518` with clear description of changes
- Ready for merge by orchestrator

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/src/abis/GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv1.ts` - ABI for v1 Gacha extension contract
- `/src/abis/GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv2.ts` - ABI for v2 Gacha extension contract  
- `/src/abis/index.ts` - Central export file for ABI modules

## Technical Details

### ABI Structure
Both ABI files follow the standard format:
```typescript
export const GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv1 = [
  // Complete ABI definition array
];
```

### Contract Mappings
- **v1 ABI** (`GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv1`): Contract `0x53c37ccc1c48f63bd35ffc93952d0880d7529b9e`
- **v2 ABI** (`GachaExtensionERC1155ABIv2`): Contract `0x40ae3553a2dbbe463f84da97bda5607cfd03b40d`

## Issues Resolved ✅
- **Critical**: Missing ABI files causing TypeScript compilation failures
- **Build**: Project can now compile without ABI-related errors
- **Import**: Proper import paths now available for ABI consumption

## Remaining Type Issues (For type-fix agent)
While ABI issues are resolved, TypeScript compilation still shows errors in:
- `src/api/manifold-api.ts` - Missing ErrorCode properties
- `src/client/index.ts` - Type mismatches in BlindMint product
- `src/config/*.ts` - Configuration type inconsistencies
- `tests/*.ts` - Test type issues

These are **NOT ABI-related** and should be handled by the type-fix specialist.

## Next Steps for Type-Fix Agent

1. **Priority 1**: Fix missing `ErrorCode` properties:
   - `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`
   - `RATE_LIMITED` 
   - `API_ERROR`
   - `INVALID_RESPONSE`

2. **Priority 2**: Resolve BlindMint product type mismatches
   - Fix `AppType.BlindMint` vs `"blind-mint"` discrepancy
   - Ensure proper inheritance in product types

3. **Priority 3**: Configuration type alignments
   - Fix `APIConfig` vs `ApiConfig` naming
   - Resolve provider config incompatibilities

## Validation

### Build Status
- ✅ ABI files exist and are properly formatted
- ✅ Exports are correctly configured
- ✅ TypeScript can resolve ABI imports
- ✅ No more missing ABI module errors

### Git Status
- ✅ All changes committed to `agent/abi-fix` branch
- ✅ Ready for orchestrator merge
- ✅ Clear commit history with descriptive messages

## Success Criteria Met ✅
- [x] Both ABI files exist in `src/abis/`
- [x] They are properly exported from `src/abis/index.ts`
- [x] TypeScript compilation errors related to missing ABIs are resolved
- [x] All work committed to `agent/abi-fix` branch

The ABI-related build failures for CON-2729 have been completely resolved. The project can now compile without missing ABI errors, allowing development to continue on other type-related issues.
