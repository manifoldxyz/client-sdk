# Account Adapters

An [account](../../reference/account.md) is required to execute on-chain transactions.\
Both [**purchase**](../product/common/purchase.md) and [**execute**](../transaction-steps/execute.md) operations require an account, as they involve triggering transactions on the userâ€™s behalf.\
The SDK provides convenient methods for creating an account using popular Web3 libraries such as [**Viem**](https://viem.sh/) and [**Ethers v5**](https://app.gitbook.com/u/QndqrRfhN8QSJcD78bVPeiUnfOQ2).
